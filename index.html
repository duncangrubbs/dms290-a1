      <p class="section-text">
        Copenhagen is the capital and most populous city of Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, the city had a population of 794,128 with 632,340 in
        Copenhagen Municipality, 104,305 in Frederiksberg Municipality, 42,989 in Tårnby Municipality, and 14,494 in Dragør Municipality.
        It forms the core of the wider urban area of Copenhagen (population 1,330,993) and the Copenhagen metropolitan area (population 2,057,142).
        Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of Zealand; another portion of the city is located on Amager, and it is separate
        from Malmö, Sweden, by the strait of Øresund. The Øresund Bridge connects the two cities by rail and road.

      <p class="section-text">
        With a state-of-the-art metro, smooth public transport, short distances and status as the best bike city in the world, getting around town to experience everything couldn't be easier than in Copenhagen.
        Copenhagen has been rated as the most bicycle-friendly city in the world since 2015, with bicycles outnumbering its inhabitants.
        In 2012 some 36% of all working or studying city-dwellers cycled to work, school, or university. With 1.27 million km covered every working day
        by Copenhagen's cyclists (including both residents and commuters), and 75% of Copenhageners cycling throughout the year. The city's bicycle
        paths are extensive and well used, boasting 400 kilometres (250 miles) of cycle lanes not shared with cars or pedestrians, and sometimes have
        their own signal systems – giving the cyclists a lead of a couple of seconds to accelerate.

          The Copenhagen S-Train, Copenhagen Metro and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using
          bus services. Nørreport Station near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, S-train, regional train, metro and bus.
          Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day. Copenhagen Central Station is the hub of the DSB railway
          network serving Denmark and international destinations.

        The Copenhagen Metro expanded radically with the opening of the City Circle Line (M3) on September 29, 2019. The new line connects
        all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including the Central Station, and opens up 17 new stations for Copenhageners. On March
        28, 2020, the 2.2 km (1.4 mi) Nordhavn extension of the Harbour Line (M4) opened. Running from Copenhagen Central Station, the
        new extension is a branch line of M3 Cityring to Osterport. The M4 Sydhavn branch is expected to open in 2024. The new metro
        lines are part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as public transport and cycling
        as opposed to automobility.

      <h3 class="section-header">History</h3>
      <p class="section-text">
        Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent archaeological
        finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion
        near today's Kongens Nytorv from c. 1020. Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the
        late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where
        Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of
        flint tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the Stone Age. Many historians believe the town
        dates to the late Viking Age, and was possibly founded by Sweyn I Forkbeard. The natural harbour and good herring stocks seem
        to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.
        The first habitations were probably centred on Gammel Strand (literally "old shore") in the 11th century or even earlier.
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum referred to it as
        Portus Mercatorum, meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the Danish of the time, Købmannahavn. Traditionally,
        Copenhagen's founding has been dated to Bishop Absalon's construction of a modest fortress on the little island of Slotsholmen
        in 1167 where Christiansborg Palace stands today. The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by Wendish pirates
        who plagued the coastline during the 12th century. Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had
        been built. Attacks by the Wends continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced
        it with Copenhagen Castle.
